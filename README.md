### YES/NO MODELS (alpha) 

## ABOUT
Model Name: None (I will make him name soon)

This model only answers YES/NO and is not at all demanding, and I haven't trained it at all.
It also doesn't answer YES/NO correctly in certain question contexts after I tested it.
This model also doesn't have a window context I will make that in the next update.

Example Conversations (expected?)

User: Are you good?

Bot: YES

User: Are you human?

Bot: NO
